@page Doxygen Adding a page to the documentation

These pages are generated by
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html). If you want to add
a new page, add a text file to the `doc` folder, ideally in the appropriate
subfolder `doc/dev` for developer information, `doc/user` for user
documentation.

At the beginning of the file, insert a line like this:

@verbatim
@page FileNameWithoutExtension The Title of the newly created page
@endverbatim

The pages use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for
formatting.

In the end, you'll also need a link to get to your page. Go to the file where
you want the link to appear, e.g. one of the `index.md` files. In there, add
a snippet `@ref FileNameWithoutExtension` at the point where you want the link.
